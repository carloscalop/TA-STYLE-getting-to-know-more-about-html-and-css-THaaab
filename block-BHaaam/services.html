Corporate Functions - What to expect

For Corporate Functions we use a special formula that works to impress your guests no matter their age or demographic each and every time. Through crowd observation our DJs select the most appropriate tracks from our comprehensive playlists that are specialised to suit different segments throughout the evening. We take pride in how we do this, we believe we do this the best, this is our art form.
Perth Function DJs

For example, as your valued guests arrive to the function, the mood is set as they are welcomed by the familiar and finger snapping sounds of artists such as Amy Winehouse "Valerie", Luther Vandross "Never Too Much" and Maroon 5 "One More Night".

As Dinner is served and table conversations are invoked, we set out to establish a sophisticated atmosphere calling on timeless artists such as Sade "Smooth Operator", Simple Red "Holding Back the Years" and UB40 "Kingston Town".

If Formalities are to follow, we work with the MC to ensure intermissions between presentations are lively, ensuring that energy levels remain high and your guests are ready for the partying ahead. Expect to hear the likes of Justin Timberlake "Like I Love You", Christina Aguilera "Lady Marmalade" and everybody's favourite, James Brown "Like a Sex Machine".

Finally the moment everyone has been waiting for. Your Soul Sound DJ is a seasoned party rocker. He or She will create that "hot club feel" on the dancefloor, skillfully mashing up the sounds of R&B, Motown, Hiphop, Funk and Disco anthems. Expect your guests to be moving to sounds of Jackson 5 "I Want You Back", Beyonce "Crazy In Love", Robin Thicke "Blurred Lines", Earth Wind & Fire "September", Lionel Ritchie "All Night Long", Prince "1999"---- the list goes on and on into the night.
