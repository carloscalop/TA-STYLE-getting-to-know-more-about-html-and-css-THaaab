               <h2>How it all started</h2>
JW DJ Agency was started in London in 2016 for 2 main reasons. We decided to take the plunge into this exhilarating world of the music industry, simply, because we had a desire to do it better.

We recognised a need in the open format market for a DJ Agency, which could bring the many facets of this business together to produce a better result for both the clients and the DJs.

We could see many venues failing to find audiences and viable entertainment options. Their managers and venue owners were ultimately not receiving the level of service that they deserved. Here at the JW DJ Agency, we understand that it benefits both parties in the business relationship to be achieving results.

As experienced DJs in the industry before the beginning of the agency, we dealt with many unscrupulous agents, who’s only goal was the monetary reward. These agencies had no recruitment or training process for their DJs, therefore supplying below standard DJs to their clients.

There was no coaching or management and often as a DJ you would be left to your own devices with no ongoing feedback on your performances.

Rarely would you ever have face to face contact with your manager during your entire working contract with them.

Unfortunately, these types of agents still exist and continue to exploit DJs due to the saturated market and their desperation for paid work.

We wanted to create a totally different ethos, where we only supply the best DJs to our clients. Our selection process is tough, but we also take the time out to train DJs with the right attitude and good work ethic. We treat our DJs with the respect they deserve and are proud to have them representing us every day.

The brands that we work with are very specific in their musical repertoires so continuous feedback and micromanagement of our team is important to the success of their venues.

It has not always been easy or a pleasant ride, but it continues to be a rewarding challenge for our passion and motivation. We are extremely proud of our 5-star ratings and continue to achieve milestones for ourselves, our DJs and our client’s.
<h2>What can you expect from our agency?</h2>
<p>You can expect an invested energy from our management team with a personalised approach.

We understand that no club, bar or private event are the same with each client having their own challenges and opportunities and we will go the extra mile to make sure that the music is on point and tailored to your event or venue requirements.
